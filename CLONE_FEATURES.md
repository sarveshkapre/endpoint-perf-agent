# Clone Feature Tracker

## Context Sources
- README and docs
- TODO/FIXME markers in code
- Test and build failures
- Gaps found during codebase exploration

## Candidate Features To Do
- [ ] P1: Add SQLite storage mode with retention controls and migration path from JSONL.
- [ ] P1: Add alert output sinks (structured JSON stream and syslog).
- [ ] P1: Add configurable static and percentile-based alert rules.
- [ ] P2: Add command-level CLI tests for validation/flag parsing flows in `cmd/epagent`.

## Implemented
- [x] 2026-02-09: Added per-sample process attribution (`top_cpu_process`, `top_mem_process`) in collector output.
  Evidence: `internal/collector/collector.go`, smoke JSONL sample from `epagent collect --once`.
- [x] 2026-02-09: Added anomaly context enrichment (timestamp + top CPU/memory process) in analysis/report output paths.
  Evidence: `internal/anomaly/anomaly.go`, `internal/report/report.go`, `internal/report/report_test.go`.
- [x] 2026-02-09: Hardened analysis flag handling by normalizing detector params and validating negative CLI values.
  Evidence: `cmd/epagent/main.go`, `internal/report/report.go`, `internal/report/filters.go`, `internal/report/filters_test.go`.
- [x] 2026-02-09: Improved JSONL diagnostics with line-numbered parse errors.
  Evidence: `internal/storage/storage.go`, `internal/storage/storage_test.go`.
- [x] 2026-02-09: Added project memory and incident tracking docs.
  Evidence: `PROJECT_MEMORY.md`, `INCIDENTS.md`.
- [x] 2026-02-09: Synced core product docs with shipped behavior.
  Evidence: `README.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/PROJECT.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`, `PLAN.md`, `UPDATE.md`.

## Insights
- Process attribution substantially improves first-pass triage, but can bias toward transient short-lived processes; follow-up benchmarking is needed on process-dense hosts.
- Detector normalization must be reflected in user-visible output; otherwise operations teams can misinterpret baselines and thresholds.
- Line-numbered JSONL parse errors materially reduce diagnosis time for corrupted collection files.

## Notes
- This file is maintained by the autonomous clone loop.
